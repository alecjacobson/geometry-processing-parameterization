<p>In this assignment we will explore how to <em>flatten</em> a surface
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">embedded</a> (or even just
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion">immersed</a>) in <span class="math">\(ℝ^3\)</span> to the flat
plane (i.e. <span class="math">\(ℝ^2\)</span>).</p>

<p>This process is often referred to as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametrization#Parametrization_techniques">parameterization</a>
because the two-dimensional coordinate system of the flattened mesh can now be
interpreted as a parameterization of the 3D surface.</p>

the surface. </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this assignment, we are given a representation of the surface in 3D as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_mesh">triangle mesh</a> with a list of
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> vertex positions <span class="math">\(\V ∈ ℝ^{n × 3}\)</span>, so then the goal is to assign <span class="math">\(uv\)</span>
coordinates to each vertex <span class="math">\(\U ∈ ℝ^{n × 2}\)</span>. </p>

<p>In general, a 3D surface cannot be flattened onto the plane without
<em><strong>distortion</strong></em>. Some parts of the surface will have to be stretched and other
squished. Surfaces with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_decomposition">topological
handles</a> or without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)#Closed_surfaces">a
boundary</a> </p>

<h3 id="mass-springmethods">Mass-spring methods</h3>

<p>If we view our triangle mesh surface as a simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a> then the
surface flattening problem reduces to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing">graph
drawing</a>. Distortion can be
measured in terms of the relative change in lengths between neighboring
vertices.</p>

<p>We can pose the graph drawing problem as an optimization over node locations so
that the lengths between neighboring vertices are minimized:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\min_\U  ∑\limits_{\{i,j\} ∈ \E} ‖\u_i - \u_j‖²,
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(\E∈\{1,…,n\}^{k × 2}\)</span> holds a list of edge indices into <span class="math">\(\V\)</span>. This
energy has a physical interpretation as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy">potential
energy</a> of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_harmonic_motion#Mass_on_a_spring">mass-spring</a>
system. Each edge represents a spring with zero rest length, all springs have
uniform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke's_law#Spring_energy">stiffness</a>,
and all vertices have equivalent (unit) mass.</p>

<p>Without additional constraints, this minimization has a trivial solution: map
all vertices to the same point, e.g., <span class="math">\(\u_i = (0\ 0),\ ∀ i\)</span>.</p>

<p>We can avoid this by fixing the mapping of certain vertices. If we choose these
fixed vertices arbitrarily we will in general get overlaps in the flattening.
For graph drawing this means that edges cross each other; for surface
parameterization this means that multiple triangles cover the same patch of the
<span class="math">\(uv\)</span>-plane and some of those triangles are upside down. This problem is often
referred to as <em>fold overs</em> or lack of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function">injectivity</a>.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/max-tutte-boundary.gif" alt="The face of Max Planck is
parameterized using a mass-spring system. More and more vertices are fixed
explicitly along the boundary. With only a few fixed vertices there are severe
overlaps and degeneracies in the interior. When the entire boundary is fixed to

<figcaption>The face of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck">Max Planck</a> is
parameterized using a mass-spring system. More and more vertices are fixed
explicitly along the boundary. With only a few fixed vertices there are severe
overlaps and degeneracies in the interior. When the entire boundary is fixed to
the circle, there are no overlaps.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In 1963, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutte_embedding">Tutte showed</a> that if
the boundary of a disk-topology mesh is fixed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon">convex
polygon</a> (and all spring
stiffness are positive) then minimizing the energy above will result in an
injective (i.e., fold-over-free) flattening.</p>

<p>While avoiding fold-overs is important, Tutte-style mappings suffer from a
couple problems.</p>

<p>If uniform spring stiffness are used, then the mapping in the <span class="math">\(uv\)</span> domain will
try to make all edges the same length. Combined with the boundary constraints,
the flattened mesh will have smoothly varying edge-lengths and near-equilateral
triangles <em>regardless</em> of the triangles shapes and sizes on the surface mesh.</p>

<img src="images/keenan-ogre-tutte.jpg" alt="The Tutte embedding of the 3D Ogre mesh leads to severe distortion.

Overlaying a checkerboard pattern on the 2D domain and visualizing it on the 3D
surface shows the wobbliness of the non-smooth mapping and
stretching.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can try to remedy this by introducing a non-uniform weight or spring
stiffness <span class="math">\(w_{ij}\)</span> for each edge <span class="math">\(\{i,j\}\)</span>:
<span class="math">\[
\min_\U  ∑\limits_{\{i,j\} ∈ \E} w_{ij} ‖\u_i - \u_j‖².
\]</span></p>

<p>For example, we could weigh the distortion of shorter edges (on the 3D mesh)
more than longer ones: <span class="math">\(w_{ij} = 1/‖\v_i - \v_j‖\)</span>. See &#8220;Parametrization and
smooth approximation of surface triangulations&#8221; [Floater 1996]. This will at
best help tame <em><strong>length distortion</strong></em>. The &#8220;shapes&#8221; (i.e., aspect ratios) of
triangles will only be indirectly preserved. We need a way to discourage <em>area
distortion</em> and <em>angle distortion</em>.</p>

<p>To do this, let&#8217;s write the energy minimization problem above in matrix form:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\min_\U ½ \tr{\U^\transpose \L \U},
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(\L ∈ \R^{n × n}\)</span> is a sparse matrix with:
<span class="math">\[
L_{ij} = \begin{cases}
w_{ij} & \text{ if $i≠j$ and $∃ \{ij\} ∈ \E$, }\\
-∑\limits_{\ell≠i} L_{i\ell} & \text{ if $i = j$, or } \\
0 & \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}.
\]</span></p>

<h4 id="whatsupwiththetrintheenergy">What&#8217;s up with the <span class="math">\(\tr{}\)</span> in the energy?</h4>

<p>The degrees of freedom in our optimization are a collected in the <em>matrix</em>
<span class="math">\(\U ∈ \R^{n×2}\)</span> with two columns. The energy is written as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)">trace</a> of the
quadratic form (a.k.a. matrix) <span class="math">\(\Q ∈ \R^{n×n}\)</span> applied to <span class="math">\(\U\)</span>. In effect,
this is really applying <span class="math">\(\Q\)</span> to each column of <span class="math">\(\U\)</span> independently and summing
the result:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\tr{\U^\transpose \Q \U} &= \\
                         &= \tr{\U^\transpose \Q \U} \\
                         &= \tr{
                                 \left[\begin{array}{c}
                                 \U_1^\transpose\\
                                 \U_2^\transpose 
                                 \end{array}\right] \Q [\U_1 \U_2] } \\
                         &= \tr{\left[\begin{array}{c}
                                 \U_1^\transpose \Q \U_1 & 
                                 \U_1^\transpose \Q \U_2 \\
                                 \U_2^\transpose \Q \U_1 & 
                                 \U_2^\transpose \Q \U_2 \end{array}\right]}
                                 \\
                        &= \U_1^\transpose \Q \U_1 + \U_2^\transpose \Q \U_2.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>

<p>The upshots of energies written as the trace of a quadratic form applied to a
matrix are that: 1) each column can be optimized <em>independently</em> (assuming
constraints are also separable by column), and this is often the case when
columns correspond to coordinates (u, v, etc.); and 2) the quadratic form for
each columns is the same (the same <span class="math">\(\Q\)</span>). For quadratic energy minimization,
this means that we can precompute work (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition">Cholesky
facotorization</a>) on
<span class="math">\(\Q\)</span> and take advantage of it for solving with <span class="math">\(\U_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\U_2\)</span> and we might
even solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">in parallel</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="dirichletenergy">Dirichlet energy</h4>

<p>We should immediately recognize this sparsity structure from the discrete
Laplacians considered in the previous assignments. If <span class="math">\(w_{ij} = 1\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\L\)</span>
is the <em>uniform Laplacian</em> (a.k.a., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix">graph
Laplacian</a>). If <span class="math">\(w_{ij}\)</span> is
based on edge-lengths, then <span class="math">\(\L\)</span> corresponds to a physical static equilibrium
problem for a linear spring system. </p>

<p>But we have more information then edges: we know that our graph is really a
discrete representation of a two-dimensional surface. Wobbliness distortions in
the parameterization correspond to high <em>variation</em> in the <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>
functions over the surface.</p>

<p>We can model the problem of parametrization as an energy minimization of
the variation in the <span class="math">\(u\)</span>- and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>-coordinate functions over the surface <span class="math">\(\S\)</span>:
<span class="math">\[
\min_{u,v} ∫_\S ‖∇u‖² + ‖∇v‖² \ dA.
\]</span>
This familiar energy is called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet's_energy">Dirichelt energy</a>.</p>

<p>We may discretize this problem immediately using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_function">piecewise linear
functions</a> spanned by
<span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> values at vertices. This corresponds to using the <em>cotangent
Laplacian</em> as <span class="math">\(\L\)</span> in the discrete minimization problem above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the smooth setting, minimizing the variation of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> will lead to
an injective mapping if the boundary is constrained to a closed convex curve.
In the discrete setting, poor triangle shapes in the original 3D mesh could
lead to <em>negative</em> cotangent weights <span class="math">\(w_{ij}\)</span> so the positive stiffness
weight assumption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutte_embedding">Tutte&#8217;s
theorem</a> is broken and
fold-overs <em>might</em> occur. Keep in mind that positive weights are a
<em>sufficient</em> condition for injectivity, but this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denying_the_antecedent">does not
imply</a> that having a
few negative weights will necessarily cause a fold-over. Even so, Floater
proposes an alternative discrete Laplacian in &#8220;Mean value coordinates&#8221; in
2003 that retains some nice shape-preserving properties without negative
weights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modeling distortion as an integral of variation over the given 3D surface is
going in the right direction, but so far we are treating <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>
<em>separately</em>. Intuitively <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> cannot &#8220;talk&#8221; to one-another during
optimization. There&#8217;s no reason to expect that they will be able to minimize
<em>area distortation</em> and <em>angle distortion</em> directly. For that we will need to
consider <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> simultaneously.</p>

<h3 id="leastsquaresconformalmappings">Least Squares Conformal Mappings</h3>

<p>We can reason about distortion in terms of differential quantities of the
mapping from <span class="math">\(\S\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\R²\)</span>. Now, ultimately we are trying to parametrize <span class="math">\(\S\)</span>
using the <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> coordinate functions spanning <span class="math">\(\R^2\)</span>, but in order to
describe energies over these unknown functions we will assume (without
explicitly using) that we have a parameterization of <span class="math">\(\S\)</span> (e.g., with
coordinates <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>). This way we can write about small changes in the
mapping function <span class="math">\(u\)</span> with respect to moving a small amount on the surface of
<span class="math">\(\S\)</span> (small changes in <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>).</p>

<h4 id="areadistortion">Area distortion</h4>

<p>We would like that regions on <span class="math">\(\S\)</span> have a proportionally similarly sized region
under the <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(v\)</span> mapping to <span class="math">\(\R²\)</span>. On an infinitesimal scale, a small change
in <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> on <span class="math">\(\S\)</span> should incur an equally small change in <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>. In
other words, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant">determinant of the
Jacobian</a> of the
mapping should be one:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{∂u}{∂x} & \frac{∂u}{∂y} \\
\frac{∂v}{∂x} & \frac{∂v}{∂y} 
\end{array}
\right|
= 1,
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(| \X | = \det{\X}\)</span> for a square matrix <span class="math">\(\X\)</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The determinant of the Jacobian of a mapping corresponds to the scale factor
by which local area expands or shrinks. This quantity also appears during
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution">integration by
substitution</a> when
multivariate functions are involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is tempting to try to throw this equality into a least squares energy an
minimize it. Unfortunately the determinant is already a quadratic function of
<span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> so a least-squares energy would be quartic and minimizing it would
be non-trivial. We will reinvestigate this in <em>later assignments</em> when we look
into surface deformation energies. But for now, let us put aside area
distortion and focus instead on angle or aspect-ratio distortion.</p>

<h4 id="angledistortion">Angle distortion</h4>

<p>We would also like that local regions on <span class="math">\(\S\)</span> are parameterized without
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_mapping">shearing</a>. This ensures that two
orthogonal directions on the surface <span class="math">\(\S\)</span> correspond to two orthogonal
directions on the parameteric plane <span class="math">\(\R²\)</span>. We can capture this by requiring
that a small change in the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> directions on <span class="math">\(\S\)</span> corresponds to equal
magnitude, small changes in <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> in perpendicular directions:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
∇u &= ∇v^⊥ \\
&↓ \\
\left( \begin{array}{r}
\frac{∂u}{∂x} \\
\frac{∂u}{∂y} \\
\end{array} \right)
 &=
\left( \begin{array}{r}
 \frac{∂v}{∂y} \\
-\frac{∂v}{∂x} \\
\end{array} \right)
\end{align}
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(\x^⊥\)</span> indicates the vector <span class="math">\(\x\)</span> rotated by by 90°.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By enlisting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis">complex
analysis</a>, we can reinterpret
the mapping to the real plane <span class="math">\(\R²\)</span> as a mapping to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane">complex

preservation equality above corresponds to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy–Riemann_equations">Cauchy-Riemann
equations</a>. Complex
functions that satisfy these equations are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map"><em><strong>conformal
maps</strong></em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This equality is linear in <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>. We can immediately build a quadratic
energy that minimizes deviation from satisfying this equation over the surface
<span class="math">\(\S\)</span> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">least squares sense</a>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\min_{u,v} ½ ∫_\S ‖∇u - ∇v^⊥‖² \ dA.
\]</span></p>

<p>This energy was employed for surface parameterization of triangle meshes as
early as &#8220;Intrinsic parameterizations of surface meshes&#8221; [Desbrun et al. 2002]
and &#8220;Least squares conformal maps for automatic texture atlas generation&#8221; [Lévy
2002]. Written in this form, it&#8217;s perhaps not obvious how we can discretize
this over a triangle mesh. Let us massage the equations a bit, starting by
expanding the squared term:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∫_\S \left(½ ‖∇u‖² + ½ ‖∇v‖² - ∇u ⋅ ∇v^⊥ \right)\ dA.
\]</span></p>

<p>We should recognize the first two terms as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet's_energy">Dirichlet
energies</a> of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>. The third term is
at first glance not familiar. Let&#8217;s massage it a bit by expanding the gradient
and dot product:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
∫_\S  ∇u ⋅ ∇v^⊥ \ dA &= \\
∫_\S \left( \begin{array}{r}
\frac{∂u}{∂x} \\
\frac{∂u}{∂y} \\
\end{array}\right)
\left( \begin{array}{r}
 \frac{∂v}{∂y} \\
-\frac{∂v}{∂x} \\
\end{array} \right) \ dA &= \\
∫_\S \left|
\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{∂u}{∂x} & \frac{∂u}{∂y} \\
\frac{∂v}{∂x} & \frac{∂v}{∂y} 
\end{array}
\right| \ dA &= 
∫_{\left(\begin{array}{c}u(\S) \\ v(\S) \end{array}\right)} 1 \ dA
,
\end{align}
\]</span>
where we end up with the integrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant">determinant of the
Jacobian</a> of the
<span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> mapping over <span class="math">\(\S\)</span>. By the rules of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution">integration by
substitution</a>, this
is equivalent to integrating the unit density function over the image of the
mapping, i.e., the <strong><em>signed</em></strong> area of the flattened surface. If we apply
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem">Stoke&#8217;s theorem</a> we can
convert this area integral into a boundary integral:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∫_{\left(\begin{array}{c}u(\S) \\ v(\S) \end{array}\right)} 1 \ dA
= ∮_{∂\left(\begin{array}{c}u(\S) \\ v(\S) \end{array}\right)} \u(s)⋅\n(s) \ ds,
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(\n\)</span> is the unit vector pointing in the outward direction along the
boundary of the image of the mapping.</p>

<p>If we discretize <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> using piecewise-linear functions then the boundary
of the mapping will also be piecewise linear and the boundary integral for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_area"><strong>vector area</strong></a> is given by the sum over all
boundary edges of the integral of the position vector <span class="math">\(\u\)</span> dotted with that
edge&#8217;s unit normal vector:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∮_{∂(\u(\S))} \u(s)⋅\n(s) \ ds = \\
  ∑\limits_{\{i,j\} ∈ ∂\S} ∫_0^1 
    ½ (\u_i + t(\u_j - \u_i))⋅\frac{(\u_j-\u_i)^⊥}{‖\u_j - \u_i‖} \ dt = \\
  ½ ∑\limits_{\{i,j\} ∈ ∂\S} (\u_j-\u_i)⋅(\u_j-\u_i)^⊥ = \\
  ½ ∑\limits_{\{i,j\} ∈ ∂\S} | \u_i\  \u_j |,
\]</span>
where finally we have a simply quadratic expression: sum over all boundary
edges the determinant of the matrix with vertex positions as columns. This
quadratic form can be written as <span class="math">\(\U^\transpose \A \U\)</span> with the <em>vectorized</em>
<span class="math">\(u\)</span>- and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>-coordinates of the mapping in <span class="math">\(\U ∈ \R^{2n}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\A ∈ \R^{2n ×
2n}\)</span> a sparse matrix involving only values for vertices on the boundary of
<span class="math">\(\S\)</span>. </p>

<p><strong><em>Achtung!</em></strong> A naive implementation of <span class="math">\(½ ∑\limits_{\{i,j\} ∈ ∂\S} | \u_i\
\u_j |\)</span> into matrix form <span class="math">\(\U^\transpose \A \U\)</span> will likely produce an
<em>asymmetric</em> matrix <span class="math">\(\A\)</span>. From a theoretical point of view, this is fine.
<span class="math">\(\A\)</span> just needs to compute the signed area of the flattened mesh. However, from
a numerical methods point of view we will almost always need out quadratic
coefficients matrix to be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix"><em>symmetric</em></a>. Fortunately,
when a matrix is acting as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form">quadratic
form</a> it is trivial to
<em>symmetrize</em>. Consider we have some asymmetric matrix <span class="math">\(\bar{\A}\)</span> defining a
quadratic form: <span class="math">\(\x^\transpose \bar{\A} \x\)</span>. The output of a quadratic form is
just a scalar, so it&#8217;s equal to its transpose:
<span class="math">\[
\x^\transpose \bar{\A} \x = \x^\transpose \bar{\A}^\transpose \x.
\]</span>
These are also equal to their average:
<span class="math">\[
\x^\transpose \bar{\A} \x = 
\x^\transpose 
\underbrace{½ (\bar{\A} + \bar{\A}^\transpose)}_{\A}
\x = 
\x^\transpose \A \x
\]</span></p>

<p>Putting this together with the Dirichlet energy terms, we can write the
discrete <em>least squares conformal mappings</em> minimization problem as:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\min_{\U ∈ \R^{2n}} 
  \U^\transpose 
  \underbrace{
  \left(
  \left(
  \begin{array}{rr}
    \L & 0 \\
    0 & \L
  \end{array}
  \right)
  - \A
  \right)
  }_{\Q}
  \U,
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(\L ∈ \R^{n × n}\)</span> is the Dirichlet energy quadratic form (a.k.a.
cotangent Laplacian) and <span class="math">\(\Q ∈ \R^{2n × 2n}\)</span> is the resulting (sparse)
quadratic form.</p>

<h4 id="freeboundary">Free boundary</h4>

<p>Similar to the mass-spring methods above, without constraints the least squares
conformal mapping energy will also have a trivial solution: set <span class="math">\(\U\)</span> to a
single point.</p>

<p>To avoid this solution, we <em>could</em> &#8220;fix two vertices&#8221; (as originally suggested by
both [Desbrun et al. 2002] and [Lévy et al. 2002]). However, this will
introduce <em>bias</em>. Depending on the two vertices we choose we will get a different
solution. If we&#8217;re really unlucky, then we might choose two vertices that the
energy would rather like to place near each other and so placing them at
arbitrary positions will introduce unnecessary distortion (i.e., high energy).</p>

<p>Instead we would like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_boundary_condition">natural boundary
conditions</a> (not to
be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_boundary_condition">Neumann boundary
conditions</a>). Natural
boundary conditions minimize the given energy in the absence of explicit (or
<em>essential</em>) boundary conditions. Natural boundary conditions are convenient if
we discretize the energy <em>before</em> differentiating to find the minimum. If our
discretization is &#8220;good&#8221;, then natural boundary conditions will fall out for
free (<em>natural</em> indeed!).</p>

<p>To obtain natural boundary conditions without bias <em>and</em> avoid the trivial
solution, we can require that the solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>minimizes the given energy,</li>
<li>has non-zero norm, and</li>
<li>is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality">orthogonal</a> to trivial
 solutions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#8217;s break these down. The first requirement simply ensures that we&#8217;re still
minimizing the given energy without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)">monkeying around with
it</a> in any way.</p>

<p>The second requirement adds the constraint that the solution <span class="math">\(\U\)</span> has <em>unit
norm</em>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∫_\S ‖\u‖² \ dA = 1.
\]</span></p>

<p>In our discrete case this corresponds to:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\U^\transpose 
  \underbrace{\left(\begin{array}{cc}\M & 0 \\ 0 & \M \end{array}\right)}_{\B} 
  \U = 1,
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(\M ∈ \R^{n × n}\)</span> is the <em>mass matrix</em> for a piecewise-linear triangle
mesh and <span class="math">\(\B ∈ \R^{2n × 2n}\)</span> is the sparse, square constraint matrix</p>

<p>This is a <em>quadratic constraint</em>. Normally that would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bad_News_Bears">bad
news</a>, but this type of
constraint results in a well-studied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix#Generalized_eigenvalue_problem">generalized Eigen value
problem</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<h5 id="generalizedeigenvalueproblem">Generalized Eigenvalue problem</h5>

<p>Consider a discrete quadratic minimization problem in <span class="math">\(\v ∈ \R^n\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\min_{\v} ½ \v^\transpose \A \v \text{ subject to } \v^\transpose \B \v = 1,
\]</span></p>

<p>where <span class="math">\(\A,\B ∈ \R^{n × n}\)</span> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix#Positive-semidefinite">positive
semi-definite</a>
matrices.</p>

<p>We can enforce this constraint via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier">Lagrange multiplier
method</a> by introducing the
scalar Lagrange multiplier <span class="math">\(λ\)</span> and looking for the saddle-point of the
<em>Lagrangian</em>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\mathcal{L}(\v,λ) = ½ \v^\transpose \A \v + λ (1 - \v^\transpose \B \v ).
\]</span></p>

<p>This occurs when <span class="math">\(∂\mathcal{L}/∂\v = 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(∂\mathcal{L}/∂λ = 0\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\A \v - λ \B \v  = 0 & → \A \v = λ \B \v,\\
1 - \v^\transpose \B \v = 0 &→  \v^\transpose \B \v = 1.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>

<p>This is the canonical form of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix#Generalized_eigenvalue_problem">generalized Eigen value
problem</a>
for which there are available numerical algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, our third constraint is that the solution is orthogonal to the trivial
solutions. There are <em>two</em> trivial solutions. They correspond to mapping all
<span class="math">\(u\)</span> values to zero and all <span class="math">\(v\)</span> values to a constant-but-non-zero value and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases_(V)#vice_versa"><em>vice-versa</em></a>.
These solutions will have <em>zero</em> energy and thus their corresponding
eigenvalues <span class="math">\(λ\)</span> will be zero. The <em>next</em> eigenmode (with next smallest
eigenvalue) will satisfy all of our criteria. See &#8220;Spectral conformal
parameterization&#8221; [Mullen et al. 2008].</p>

<p>This eigenvector is sometimes called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_connectivity#Fiedler_vector">Fiedler
vector</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="canonicalrotation">Canonical rotation</h4>

<p>The least squares conformal mapping energy is <em>invariant</em> to translation and
rotation. The eigen decomposition process described above will naturally take
care of &#8220;picking&#8221; a canonical translation by pulling the solution <span class="math">\(\U\)</span> toward
the origin. The rotation it returns, however, will be arbitrary.</p>

<p>We can try to find a canonical rotation by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principle component
analysis</a> on the
returned <span class="math">\(uv\)</span> coordinates in <span class="math">\(U ∈ \R^{n × 2}\)</span> (where now <span class="math">\(U\)</span> places all <span class="math">\(u\)</span>
coordinates in the first column and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> coordinates in the second column). </p>

<p>For mappings with strong reflectional symmetry then singular value
decomposition on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance">covariance
matrix</a> <span class="math">\(\U^\transpose \U ∈ \R^{2 ×
2}\)</span> will produce a rotation that aligns the principle direction of <span class="math">\(\U\)</span> with
the &#8220;<span class="math">\(x\)</span>&#8221;-axis of the parametric domain.</p>

<p>If the surface has only a small boundary then <em>all</em> of the surface will have to
be packed inside the interior. We&#8217;re not directly punishing <em>area</em> distortion
so in order to satisfy the <em>angle</em> distortion. <em>Freeing</em> the boundary helps a
little, but ultimately the only way to mitigate this is to: 1) trade area
distortion for angle distortion or 2) <em>cut</em> (a.k.a. &#8220;interrupt&#8221;) the mapping
with discontinuities (see, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goode_homolosine_projection">Goode homolosine projection used for maps of
Earth</a>).</p>

<p>Cutting new boundaries is <em>always</em> necessary for parameterizing <em>closed</em>
surfaces. It is (still in 2017) difficult to choose the cuts in an automatic
way. <em>Good opportunity for a final project ;-)</em>.</p>
